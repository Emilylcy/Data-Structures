How much time did you spend on the homework
I spent around 6-7 hours on the homework. 

What did you learn from this homework
I learned a lot but mostly about inheritance and expandable array.

optional: What did you struggle with during this homework
I struggled mostly in LookupZip.java, because I was not sure how to find a place from one file in another file that has different properties
the design of readZipCodes is really challenging for me.


optional: any other feedback you would like to share
I think probably add a few more hints about how to design, so it will be more inspirational.
