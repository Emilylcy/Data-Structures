There is a huge speedup, in HW04, the runtime is about 33seconds, but here is the result for this homework:
real    0m2.095s
user    0m2.466s
sys     0m0.551s

I spent around 10-15 hours but its mostly spent on the lab..
I learned a lot about AVLTree and its runtime. 
This semsester I learned a lot about different data structures. It is a very tiring and stressful process but rewarding:)
